Lab - Changing Document Shape with $project
Remember that when using $project to be selective on which fields you pass further, the only field you must specify to remove is _id. When you specify a field to retain (title: 1), $project assumes that all other fields you haven't specified to retain should be removed.

var pipeline = [
  {
    $match: {
      "imdb.rating": { $gte: 7 },
      genres: { $nin: [ "Crime", "Horror" ] } ,
      rated: { $in: ["PG", "G" ] },
      languages: { $all: [ "English", "Japanese" ] }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: { _id: 0, title: 1, "rated": 1 }
  }
]
