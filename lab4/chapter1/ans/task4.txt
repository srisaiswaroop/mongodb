db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      title: {
        $type: "string"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      title: { $split: ["$title", " "] },
      _id: 0
    }
  },
  {
    $match: {
      title: { $size: 1 }
    }
  }
]).itcount()
We begin with a $match stage, ensuring that we only allow movies where the title is a string

db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      title: {
        $type: "string"
      }
    }
  },
Next is our $project stage, splitting the title on spaces. This creates an array of strings

{
  $project: {
    title: { $split: ["$title", " "] },
    _id: 0
  }
},
We use another $match stage to filter down to documents that only have one element in the newly computed title field, and use itcount() to get a count

  {
    $match: {
      title: { $size: 1 }
    }
  }
]).itcount()
