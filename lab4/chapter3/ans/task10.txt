For this lab the correct answer would be

db.air_alliances.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { name: "OneWorld" }
  },
  {
    $graphLookup: {
      startWith: "$airlines",
      from: "air_airlines",
      connectFromField: "name",
      connectToField: "name",
      as: "airlines",
      maxDepth: 0,
      restrictSearchWithMatch: {
        country: { $in: ["Germany", "Spain", "Canada"] }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $graphLookup: {
      startWith: "$airlines.base",
      from: "air_routes",
      connectFromField: "dst_airport",
      connectToField: "src_airport",
      as: "connections",
      maxDepth: 1
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      validAirlines: "$airlines.name",
      "connections.dst_airport": 1,
      "connections.airline.name": 1
    }
  },
  { $unwind: "$connections" },
  {
    $project: {
      isValid: {
        $in: ["$connections.airline.name", "$validAirlines"]
      },
      "connections.dst_airport": 1
    }
  },
  { $match: { isValid: true } },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$connections.dst_airport"
    }
  }
])
This pipeline takes the most selective collection first, air_alliances, matching the document refering to the OneWorld alliance.

db.air_alliances.aggregate([
{
  $match: { name: "OneWorld" }
}
It then iterates, with maxDepth 0 on the air_airlines collection to collect the details on the airlines, specially their base airport, but restricting that $lookup to airlines of the requested countries [Spain, Germany, Canada], using restrictSearchWithMatch.

{
  $graphLookup: {
    startWith: "$airlines",
    from: "air_airlines",
    connectFromField: "name",
    connectToField: "name",
    as: "airlines",
    maxDepth: 0,
    restrictSearchWithMatch: {
      country: { $in: ["Germany", "Spain", "Canada"] }
    }
  }
}
We then iterate over all routes up to maximum of one layover by setting our maxDepth to 1. We find all possible destinations when departing from the base airport of each carrier by specify $airlines.base in startWith

{
  $graphLookup: {
    startWith: "$airlines.base",
    from: "air_routes",
    connectFromField: "dst_airport",
    connectToField: "src_airport",
    as: "connections",
    maxDepth: 1
  }
}
We now have a document with a field named connections that is an array of all routes that are within 1 layover. We use a $project here to remove unnecessary information from the documents. We also need to include information about valid airlines that match our initial restriction and the name of the current airline.

{
  $project: {
    validAirlines: "$airlines.name",
    "connections.dst_airport": 1,
    "connections.airline.name": 1
  }
}
After this, we'll unwind our connections array, and then use $project to add a field representing whether this particular route is valid, meaning it is a route flown by one of our desired carriers.

{ $unwind: "$connections" },
{
  $project: {
    isValid: {
      $in: ["$connections.airline.name", "$validAirlines"]
    },
    "connections.dst_airport": 1
  }
}
Lastly, we use $match to filter out invalid routes, and then $group them on the destination.

{ $match: { isValid: true } },
{
  $group: {
    _id: "$connections.dst_airport"
  }
}
An important aspect to this pipeline is that the first $graphLookup will act as a regular $lookup since we are setting a maxDepth to zero. The reason why we are taking this approach is due to the match restriction that $graphLookup allows, which can make this stage more efficient. Think back to the earlier lab on $lookup, can you think of a way to simplify the aggregation using $graphLookup instead?
